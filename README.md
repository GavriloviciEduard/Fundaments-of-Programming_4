# Description of the application

Planes and Passengers

Considering an airport, there are several planes (identified by name, number, airline company,
number of seats, destination, list of passengers) and each plane has certain passengers
(identified by first name, last name and passport number).

Develop an application to allow CRUD operations on passengers and planes.
The application should be layered, tested and validated.
 

Extend the application to include the following features:

      *Sort the passengers in a plane by last name*
  
      *Sort planes according to the number of passengers with the first name starting with a given letter*
  
      *Sort planes according to the string obtained by concatenation of the number ofpassengers in the plane and the plane number (for instance, for 120 passengers and
        plane number A134 the string is 120A134)*
  
      *Identify planes that have passengers with passport numbers starting with the same 3 letters*
  
      *Identify passengers from a given plane for which the first name or last name contain a string given as parameter*
  
      *Identify plane/planes where there is a passenger with given name*


  A single sort algorithm should be used for all sort requirements.
  A single search algorithm should be used for all search requirement.

 Extend the application to include the following features:
 
      *Form groups of k passengers from the same plane but with different last names (k is a value given by the user)*
  
      *Form groups of k planes with the same destination but belonging to different airline companies (k is a value given by the user)*
  
  
  A single backtracking algorithm should be used.
